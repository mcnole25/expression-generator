How many ways can you add & multiply 3 numbers to equal n?

If n were equal to, say, 8, then we get 11 possibilities.

```
(1 + 1) * 4
(2 + 2) * 2
(3 + 1) * 2
2 * 2 * 2
2 * 2 + 4
3 * 2 + 2
3 + 3 + 2
4 + 2 + 2
4 + 3 + 1
5 + 2 + 1
6 + 1 + 1
```

Note: This program was rewritten to be faster & more efficient.

Multiplication is normally performed over addition, from the order of operations convention. We use parentheses in addition to indicate calculation done there first.

This tool is pretty simple so we don't have many features yet.
